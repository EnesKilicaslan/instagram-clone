# Instagram Clone

This project has no commercial or financial aim, it is just for education purpose.

I developed this project by following @ademilter's [instagram clone video tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piBI6uxYjMg&list=PLadt0EaV4m3AvmC3HzZ0Y2-u_Nunhj8qN). He was using **Vue.JS** but I used **React.JS**

## How to access

You don't have to install the source codes and run the project just to see how the project looks like, instead you can just [here](https://eneskilicaslan.github.io/instagram-clone/).

## How to Run

After cloning the repository,

install the dependencies

```
yarn install
```

before calling the start script, you need to remove the `basename` parameter from `<BrowserRouter>` component in the **index.js** file on root directory.

Now you are ready to go, call the start script

```
yarn start
```
